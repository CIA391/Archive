    <div class="description">
      <p>Over the years, many <i>Halo</i> websites and online resources have come and gone, often vanishing without notice or a trace. Their disappearance means the loss of irreplaceable information, valuable media and precious insights into the franchise's long and storied past. These archives represent Halopedia's attempt to preserve these websites and experiences, in the hopes that they may still be enjoyed by past and future fans alike in the years to come.</p>
      <p>These archives are not always exact mirrors of the originals. Where necessary, we will upgrade them to utilise newer technologies and remove outdated technologies such as Microsoft Silverlight, so that they can be easily access on modern browsers. Furthermore, some websites may have been lost in their entirety, and had to be reconstructed with what records we have. These are marked with an asterisk, *. In all cases, though, our priority is staying true to the originals in every respect possible.</code></p>
